            I am a dedicated Junior Web Developer with a strong foundation in
            web development technologies. I specialize in creating interactive,
            user-friendly, and responsive web applications using HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose,
            Axios, and JWT. I've successfully built projects like e-commerce
            platforms and blogs with authentication. Constantly improving my
            skills, I aim to work on innovative projects and collaborate with
            talented teams to deliver impactful web solutions.
